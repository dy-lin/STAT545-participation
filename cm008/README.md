### Viewing and linking to HTML files

Viewing an HTML file on GitHub only shows you the HTML code, not the rendered script. You’ll need to provide a link to a rendered, viewable version of each HTML file you produce. Here’s how you do that using [_GitHub Pages_](https://pages.github.com/):

1. Enable “GitHub pages” on your repo:
    * Go to “settings” on your repo, and stay on the default “Options” tab.
    * Scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section.
    * Under “Source”, click the “None” drop-down button, and select the branch you want to turn into a website (probably “Master”).
1. Also under the “GitHub Pages” section, you’ll find your website URL. Make note of this URL.
    * This URL will show a rendered version of your repo’s README, but this is not important.
1. Obtain the URL to HTML file on your repo:
    * Start with your GitHub Pages URL that you made note of in Step 2. This points to the root of your repository.
    * Get the path to an HTML file you want to view. It should be something like `/path/to/file.html` (in this case, `file.html` lives in the `to` folder, which lives in the `path` folder in the root of your repo).
    * Append the path to the HTML file to your GitHub Pages URL. Try the URL to see that it works.
1. Make it easy for a visitor to your repo to find the rendered HTML file! Add a link to the rendered HTML file somewhere in your repo, probably in a README file in your homework folder.
