# Class Meeting 001
This folder does not contain a GitHub pages `HTML` link, as this lecture was about GitHub-flavoured Markdown.

## Files
* [`navigating_github.md`](https://github.com/dy-lin/STAT545-participation/blob/master/cm001/navigating_github.md)
## Instructions
These instructions were taken from the Class Meeting 001 [section](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.com/introduction-to-stat-545-and-github.html) section of the guide.

### Navigating GitHub

1. Together: Make a new file on your participation repository:
    * Click on the “Create New File” button on your repository’s home page.
    * Call it `navigating_github.md`
    * Leave it blank, and commit (“save”) the file by clicking on green “commit new file” button at the bottom of the page.
1. Together: Add the following URL’s to your `navigating_github.md` file (click on the pen button to edit), together with some commentary:
    * The repository for the STAT 545 home page, called `STAT545-home` (use this if the site ever goes down!)
    * The account it’s under.
    * Whether the account is a _user account_ or an _Org_.
1. Together: Commit the changes.
1.  Your turn: Continue the exercise, and add more URL’s (with more commentary):
    * The URL to your participation repo
    * The URL to your user account page
1. Your turn: Commit the changes.
