## Instructions

### Navigating GitHub

#### Together: Make a new file on your participation repository:
* Click on the “Create New File” button on your repository’s home page.
* Call it `navigating_github.md`
* Leave it blank, and commit (“save”) the file by clicking on green “commit new file” button at the bottom of the page.

#### Together: Add the following URL’s to your `navigating_github.md` file (click on the pen button to edit), together with some commentary:
* The repository for the STAT 545 home page, called `STAT545-home` (use this if the site ever goes down!)
* The account it’s under.
* Whether the account is a _user account_ or an _Org_.
#### Together: Commit the changes.
#### Your turn: Continue the exercise, and add more URL’s (with more commentary):
* The URL to your participation repo
* The URL to your user account page
#### Your turn: Commit the changes.
