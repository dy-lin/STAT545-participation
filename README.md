## Instructions
These instructions were taken from the Participation Assessment [webpage](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/participation/) of the course website.

**Due:** Monday, October 21, at 23:59.

The intent of the participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities, which are usually coding sessions. You’ll be putting all your in-class work in your own participation repository hosted on your GitHub user account, which we will evaluate at the end of the course.

### Expectations
In short, we’re evaluating _completeness_, not _correctness_. Specifically:

Your participation component will be evaluated by the completeness of your repository. You’ll be prompted in class when you should be contributing to your participation repository.

#### Completeness (70%)
Your repository should be complete with all in-class exercises. Your work should resemble an honest _attempt_ at the activities, but **does not** need to be anywhere near “correct” – even completely failing at an activity will earn you full marks here!

Each of the 14 classes wil receive equal weight here (5% per class).

<!-- #####  Participation Checklist -->
#### Documentation (30%)

Your repository should be _well-documented_.

* 10%: Does your main README orient a stranger to your repository?
* 10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your repository are for, and where they are located?
* 10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? Although we aren’t expecting publication-quality prose, there should be a moderate level of readability of your scripts to earn you full points here.

#### Missing Class
If you miss class, you can still do the activities another time.

### Setup

Here are the instructions to set up your participation repository.

1. On your user account, make a new repository:
    * Click the “+” in the top-right corner -> “New repository”
    * Call it `STAT545-participation`
    * We highly recommend making this a _public_ repo. But if you so desire, make it private. You can change this later.
    * Say YES to initializing with a README.
1. Add the teaching team as collaborators:
    * Click on “Settings” -> “Collaborators”.
    * Add the instructors: `vincenzocoia` and `firasm`
    * Add the TA’s (see note below)
        * Alejandra: `aleurcelay`
        * Hossam: `hsmohammed`
        * Victor: `wvictor14`
        * Yulia: `yuliaUU`
 1. Submit your participation repo to canvas right away, by submitting a URL to the repo.
     * Don’t worry, we won’t grade it until it’s finished.
     
**Note:** If your participation repo is private, and you have a free GitHub account without the student developer pack, you will be limited to adding three collaborators. Add the instructors (`vincenzocoia` and `firasm`), along with the TA who will be grading your participation repo. Will be listed later.

### Submitting your participation repository

If you’ve completed Step 3 in the above “Setup” section, you don’t have to do anything. We will grade your repository as it was on the last commit before the deadline.
